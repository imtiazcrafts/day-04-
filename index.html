    <h2><span style="color:brown">Name: </span> Mr Bean</h2>

    <h2><u>About Mr Bean</u></h2>
    <h3>Background</h3>
    <p class="first">Mr. Bean lives alone in his small flat in Highbury, North London. He's almost always seen in his trademark tweed jacket and skinny red tie. Mr. Bean rarely speaks, and when he does, it's generally only a few mumbled words, which are in a comically low-pitched voice. He's been shown in the first episode to have a strong knowledge of trigonometry. <br> <br>

        His ingenuity often leads him to finding ridiculous and impractical solutions to these problems (such as painting a room by putting fireworks into a paint can). Bean will often get confused at the world, not understanding what's going on. He's also quite selfish â€” if someone is doing something he doesn't like, he gets very agitated. He also doesn't like people taking his things. <br> <br>
        
        Mr. Bean often seems unaware of basic aspects of the way the world works, and the program usually features his attempts at what would normally be considered simple tasks, such as going swimming, redecorating, or going to church. The humor largely comes from his original (and often absurd) solutions to problems and his total disregard for others when solving them, his pettiness, and occasional malevolence. He acts silly sometimes.</p>
        <h3>Personality</h3>
        <p class="sec" style="text-align: center;">Mr. Bean is often portrayed as a childish buffoon. He is usually obnoxious, crazy, selfish and sometimes seems stupid. He can sometimes be a gentlemen towards other women, like Roxy and Sabine, but he doesn't show much care to his girlfriend which was proven in many episodes (live-action and animated). Mr. Bean often pretends his teddy is real but he doesn't always treat Teddy nicely. Mr. Bean is also a pain to the Reliant Regal in loads of episodes becoming a running gag in the series. In a few occasions, Mr. Bean had been a bit kind but he rarely shows it. He also tends to hate Irma ki$$ing him, and whenever Irma does this to him, he would usually smudge his cheek.</p>
